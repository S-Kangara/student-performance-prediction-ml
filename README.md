# 🎓 Student Performance Prediction System

This project predicts whether a student will Pass or Fail based on academic and behavioral data using fundamental data science concepts.

## 📌 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze student academic data such as subject marks, attendance, and study hours, and predict student performance (Pass/Fail).

## 🧠 Concepts Used
- Python Programming
- Working with CSV files
- Pandas DataFrames
- Basic Statistics
- Data Cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Supervised Machine Learning
- Logistic Regression
- Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix)

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset is stored in a CSV file and contains the following attributes:
- Math score
- English score
- Attendance percentage
- Daily study hours

The target variable (output) is student performance (Pass/Fail).

## ⚙️ Project Workflow
1. Load student data from a CSV file
2. Perform data cleaning and validation
3. Analyze data using basic statistics
4. Visualize data to identify patterns
5. Prepare features and target variable
6. Split data into training and testing sets
7. Train a Logistic Regression model
8. Evaluate model performance
9. Predict student performance for new inputs

## 🚀 How to Run the Project
1. Install required libraries
2. Run the main Python file
3. Enter student details when prompted
4. View the prediction result (Pass/Fail)

## 📊 Model Output
The model predicts student performance based on input features and evaluates accuracy using a test dataset.
